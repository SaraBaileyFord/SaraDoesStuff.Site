        <h1>BIO</h1>
        <p id="bio">
            Growing up from all around New South Whales, Australia - I have seen and learned a lot of various things thoughout my life. I grew from a family of artists and animal lovers, diverse personalities and cultures, taking part in many experiences and absorbing them. <br>
            I Have always endeared the world of technology as a kid though, ever since i first watched Marvel's Iron Man - which then sparked my neverending love for software and hardware.

        <p id="goals">
            Ive gone from one part of the creative industry to the next. Playing with cameras, taking apart my laptops and PC's, video editing, entertaining, doing freelance art commissions since i was an early teen even. <br>
            More recently, however - i have taken on the challenges of software and electrical engineering, something i felt i greatly missed out on for a majority of my lifetime up until now! <br>
            since early 2020, I have taken the opportunity to learn programming languages like C#, C++, Swift & of course HTML/CSS/JS more recently! This site will be monument of these learnings and that i continue to develop it over the years to show my adventures into the industry - and that it can prove my capabilities ive learned on my own!
